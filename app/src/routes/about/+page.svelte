    BearScheduler is the work of a WashU student frustrated with the poor user experience of Workday
    and the other course information sites. It hosts a course catalog and a tool for students to
    both build their own schedule and automatically generate schedules based on courses they wish to
    take. If you would like to get in touch, please do so
    <a href="/about/contact" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">here</a>.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Data Sources</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700">
    We source our data from Workday and the Registrar's website automatically. The data is updated
    at least every 24 hours, and more frequently around the registration period. If you find a
    mistake in course information, such as missing or incorrect courses, please
    <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">report it</a>.
    While it would be great to add more information about, for example, prerequisites or course
    reviews, the university makes very little available.
